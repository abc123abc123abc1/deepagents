# Deep Agent

Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is the simplest form of an agent. 
This architecture, however, can yield agents that are “shallow” and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks. 
Applications like “Deep Research”, “Manus, and “Claude Code” have gotten around this limitation by implementing a combination of four things:
a **planning tool**, **sub agents**, access to a **file system**, and a **detailed prompt**.

`deepagents` is a Python package that implements these in a general purpose way so that you can easily create a Deep Agent for your application.

## Installation

```bash
pip install deepagent
```

## Usage

```python
import os
from typing import Literal

from tavily import TavilyClient
from deepagent import create_deep_agent


# Search tool to use to do research
def internet_search(
    query: str,
    max_results: int = 5,
    topic: Literal["general", "news", "finance"] = "general",
    include_raw_content: bool = False,
):
    """Run a web search"""
    tavily_async_client = TavilyClient(api_key=os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"])
    return tavily_async_client.search(
        query,
        max_results=max_results,
        include_raw_content=include_raw_content,
        topic=topic,
    )


# Prompt prefix to steer the agent to be an expert researcher
research_prompt_prefix = """You are an expert researcher. Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.

You have access to a few tools.

## `internet_search`

Use this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.
"""

# Create the agent
agent = create_deep_agent(
    [internet_search],
    research_prompt_prefix,
)
```
