# 🥑 Python Basics Project

A comprehensive demonstration of Python fundamentals and advanced concepts, perfect for learning and reference.

## 📋 Overview

This project contains `avocado.py`, a well-structured Python file that demonstrates all the essential concepts of Python programming. It's designed as an educational resource that covers everything from basic data types to advanced features like decorators and context managers.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Python Concepts Covered:

1. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Numbers (int, float, complex)
   - Strings (single, double, multiline, f-strings)
   - Booleans and None

2. **Data Structures**
   - Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
   - List operations and slicing
   - Comprehensions

3. **Control Structures**
   - If/elif/else statements
   - For and while loops
   - List/dictionary comprehensions

4. **Functions**
   - Basic functions with parameters
   - Default parameters and variable arguments
   - Lambda functions and higher-order functions
   - Type hints

5. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Classes and objects
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
   - Magic methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`)
   - Class and instance variables

6. **Error Handling**
   - Try/except/else/finally blocks
   - Custom exceptions
   - Proper error handling patterns

7. **File Handling**
   - Reading and writing files
   - Context managers (`with` statement)
   - File operations best practices

8. **Modules and Imports**
   - Using standard library modules
   - Import patterns
   - Module demonstration

9. **Advanced Features**
   - Decorators
   - Generators
   - Context managers
   - Functional programming concepts

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Code

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (for installing testing dependencies)
